#Emotion-Aware Dog Filter

This project aims to develop a dog filter that can detect a person's emotion and superimpose a dog mask specific to that emotion. The filter will use computer vision to detect the person's face and identify their facial expressions. It will then use a machine learning model to classify the person's emotion. Once the emotion is classified, the filter will superimpose a corresponding dog mask on the person's face.

The project will be developed using Python and the following libraries:

OpenCV: for computer vision tasks such as face detection and facial expression recognition
TensorFlow: for machine learning tasks such as training and deploying emotion classifiers
The project will be divided into the following phases:

Data collection: A dataset of face images with corresponding emotion labels will be collected. The dataset will be used to train the machine learning model.
Model training: A machine learning model will be trained to classify emotions based on facial expressions. The model will be trained using the collected dataset.
Filter development: A dog filter will be developed using OpenCV and TensorFlow. The filter will use the trained model to classify emotions and superimpose corresponding dog masks.
Evaluation: The filter will be evaluated on a held-out dataset to assess its accuracy and performance.
The project is expected to have the following benefits:

It will provide a fun and engaging way for people to express themselves.
It can be used to study the relationship between emotions and facial expressions.
It can be used to develop new applications in the fields of computer vision and machine learning.
Potential applications:

Social media filters
Video games
